Welcome to my first blog post, I have been meaning to do this from quite sometime, but haven’t had the courage to do so until now. Instead of introducing myself - which is always a hard thing to do - I will let my future blog posts do that for me, but for starters I can tell you this:

I am usually a quite person, the kind that tends to observe rather than speak. I formed my own set of ideas throughout my years…which I usually keep to myself. Lately, I have been having the urge to talk instead of staying silent; that it is time to let these thoughts see the light, instead of keeping them trapped inside my mind. 

### Why should you read my blog?

I believe that each and every person has an extra drop to contribute to the sea of knowledge, and we are lucky enough to be living in an age where that is possible. The internet is an amazing tool for the accumulation of human knowledge, and I strongly recommend that you start your own blog as well. We all see the world through a different lens, it’s time to share those unique experiences and ideas with us.

That said, I won’t be sad if no one reads, as that might be indeed the case. I am writing this blog mainly for myself, to express my thoughts and feelings instead of caging them inside me as I have always had. I also want my future self to read what I have written and in that way I would be documenting the way I think and write.

### What will I write?

I won’t limit myself to a specific theme or topic. I will be writing short stories, movie/book reviews, opinions, technical stuff, whatever I feel appropriate at the time. I am challenging myself to write a blog post every week. Here is to hoping that I actually do that.

### Fun Fact

For the non-tech people out there, you may wonder why I chose the title “Hello World.” Well, other than the obvious reason, it is customary for programmers when they learn a new programming language to write a simple program that displays the characters of “Hello World! in that way the programmer familiarizes herself with the syntax and structure of that new language. It also means that the programmer’s code can compile, load, run and display the output, which is always a good first step towards mastering a language. It’s grown to become a time-honored tradition; all programers that came before you felt that same rush of adrenaline after realizing they successfully communicated through the computer. I like to think of it also as if the computer gains sentience when the program runs, and in an urge to announce its existence, it screams to the world “Hello”. 

Here is a simple Hello World program in C. 

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

**Where did it come from?** It was created by Brian Kernighan, author of one of the most widely read programming books: C Programming Language. He first referenced ‘Hello World’ in the C Programming Language book’s predecessor: A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B published in 1973.
